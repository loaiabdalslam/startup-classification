# Project-02 - Classification

## Overview
As a potential investor or hire, how can you assess whether to further invest or join a startup? This project will predict type of exit (acquisition, IPO, shutdown) for a startup given current funding and company information.
This can help potential investors or employees to look out factors to assess a startup and the potential exit path.

## Potential Challenges
* The initial data is in mysql, and will need to migrate to the required postgress sql for analysis with a tool that does not result in data fidelity issues during migration
* There is some data cleaning needed to filter out companies with the predictor value to include in training set
* There is also initial data engineering needed to generate the desired features from the raw data set
* If the initial proposed features are not good predictors, more time maybe needed to research what makes better predictor features
